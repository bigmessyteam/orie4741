Our project objective is to help Expedia provide the best hotel recommendation for its users. We plan to use analytical approach to study users' preferences based on their input parameters. (from/to locations, # of adults or children, date requested and etc.) Ultimately, our algorithm will improve performance of Expedia's hotel search function and achieve higher customer satifaction.
