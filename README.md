Our project objective is to help Expedia predict whether a hotel will be booked and how much the booking would cost based on a set of features. We plan to use analytical approach to study hotel booking based on users' input parameters. (from/to locations, # of adults or children, date requested and etc.) Ultimately, our algorithm will help Expedia understand their user behavior, improve performance of Expedia's hotel search function and achieve higher customer satifaction.
